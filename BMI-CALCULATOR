def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    # Calculate BMI
    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
    
    # Determine the BMI category
    if bmi < 18.5:
        category = "Underweight"
    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 24.9:
        category = "Normal weight"
    elif 25 <= bmi < 29.9:
        category = "Overweight"

# Example usage
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilograms: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

bmi, category = calculate_bmi(weight, height)

print(f"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")
print(f"You are categorized as: {category}")

SAMPLE OUTPUT :

Enter your weight in kilograms: 5
Enter your height in meters: 3
Your BMI is: 0.56
You are categorized as: Underweight
